I converted the code from python 2 to 3, started with the user vs AI gamemode, translated the variables and documentation snippets from swedish to english, added some additional documentation. Next week I aim to finish the user vs AI gamemode, then start with cleaning up the code, putting things into classes instead of having only methods.
