# Weekly Log 1
I came up with my project subject this week and wrote the inital ReadMe and copied parts of it over into the Requirements documenation file. Next week I will research how to approach my project: what kind of AI methods I will use, looking at similar projects how they went about it. I will also add on the Player vs AI mode to the game which is currently only AI vs AI.
